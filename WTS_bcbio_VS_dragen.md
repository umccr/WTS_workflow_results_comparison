# Description

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">

**SAMPLE: MDX190024_UR3044456_T_rna**

For each WTS workflow output type (abundance and fusions for now), the document currently reports:

- File names in the input (parms) directories
- The number and comparison of calls
- The key difference between both outputs (i.e. bcbio VS Dragen) in a tabular format

</div>

# Counts

This section summarizes two key factors:

- a summary of the total number of counts in the compared files and 
- a table outlining difference between both runs.


```r
###Start with the simple line count in the files i.e. the number of entries in the output from both runs is same.
#compare the count files first (from both runs)
counts.dragen <- read.table(here("../../data/projects/WTS_comparison/MDX190024_UR3044456_T_rna/dragen/UR3044456_WTS.quant.sf"), sep="\t", as.is=TRUE, header=TRUE)
counts.bcbio <-  read.table(here("../../data/projects/WTS_comparison/MDX190024_UR3044456_T_rna/bcbio/abundance.tsv"), sep="\t", as.is=TRUE, header=TRUE)

#read in the tximport data

### Total counts

Also, in the report, we calculate TPMs from gene level count estimates. So the above data should suffice.


```r
###merge both input dataframes on target_id but only keep tpm from second dataframe and target_id and tpms from first dataframe
icombined_tpm <- merge(x = counts.bcbio[,c('target_id', 'tpm')], y = counts.dragen[,c('target_id','tpm')], by = "target_id", all.x = TRUE)
colnames(icombined_tpm) <- c('target_id', 'tpm_bcbio', 'tpm_dragen')
###function calls
scatterPlot(icombined_tpm, main_title = "Trascripts per million (tpm) values across bcbio and dragen")
violinPlot(icombined_tpm, main_title = "Trascripts per million (tpm) values across bcbio and dragen runs")
```

# Fusions Analysis

This section includes a summary of:

- the total number of fusions in the compared files and 
- a table outlining difference between both runs.
  - The fields checked are fusion gene names.
  

```r
###compare the fusion calls (from both runs)
fusions.bcbio <-  read.table(here("../../data/projects/WTS_comparison/MDX190024_UR3044456_T_rna/bcbio/UR3044456-flat.tsv"), sep="\t", as.is=TRUE, header=TRUE)
fusions.arriba <- read.table(here("../../data/projects/WTS_comparison/MDX190024_UR3044456_T_rna/bcbio/fusions.tsv"), sep="\t", as.is=TRUE, header=TRUE)
fusions.dragen <- read.table(here("../../data/projects/WTS_comparison/MDX190024_UR3044456_T_rna/dragen/UR3044456_WTS.fusion_candidates.final"), sep="\t", as.is=TRUE, header=FALSE)
colnames(fusions.dragen) <- c("FusionGene", "Score", "LeftBreakpoint", "RightBreakpoint", "ReadNames")
```


```r
fusions.bcbio.filtered <- fusions.bcbio %>%
  dplyr::filter(splitcount>1) 

fusions.dragen.processed <- fusions.dragen %>%
  tidyr::separate(col = FusionGene, into = c("gene1", "gene2"), sep = "--")
  
```


```r
###find common fusion gene pairs between both arriba and dragen. Return all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.
fusions.common <- inner_join(fusions.arriba, fusions.dragen.processed)

###find different fusion gene pairs between both arriba and dragen. Return all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.
fusions.diff.arriba <- anti_join(fusions.arriba, fusions.dragen.processed, by = c("gene1", "gene2"))
fusions.diff.dragen <- anti_join(fusions.dragen.processed, fusions.arriba, by = c("gene1", "gene2"))
